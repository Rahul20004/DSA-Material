Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array nums which is sorted in non-decreasing order (smallest to largest, duplicates allowed).

Task:
➔ Remove the duplicates directly inside the same array (in-place).
➔ Keep only one occurrence of each element.
➔ Return the number of unique elements.

Important conditions:

Do not use extra space like another array.

Order must be preserved (don't shuffle elements).

After k elements, whatever remains in the array doesn't matter.

Code:
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int i = 0;
        for(int j= 1; j< nums.length;j++){
            if(nums[j] != nums[i]){
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i+1; // Total Unique elements count
        
    }
}
